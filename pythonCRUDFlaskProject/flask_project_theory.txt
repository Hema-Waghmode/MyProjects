Web Application
===============
Web application is a website that is applied to 
solve certain purpose.

For. e.g: flipkart,amazon these solve purpose of
          online shopping.


Web Architecture
================

            ----Request----->
      client                 Server
	  
	        <---Response----
			
		Browser is a client

	          ----Request----> 
	  Browser                  Server
	         <---Response-----

                   Home page
				   contact page
				   Placements
				   
	 technologies for web application
	 
      
            ----Request----->
      client                 Server |DBMS(mysql)
	  
	        <---Response----

     Frontend                Backend       sql
	 HTML                    python,php
	 CSS                     java,c# etc
	 JS



Need of Framework
=================
1) Framework provides you ready made code for
   generic functionality which can be edited, this
   save lot of time in application developement.
   e.g: login and registration functionality.

2) Security
   Framework provides ready made security

3) scalability


Types of Framework
1) Front end Frameworks
2) Backend Frameworks 

Front end
css-> Bootstrap
js -> Jquery,Angular.

backend
python: flask and Django
PHP   : codeognitor,Laravel,cakePHP etc
Java  : Spring Hibernet.


Virtual Enviroment
==================
Every project must have virtual enviroment created,
so that all dependencies or modules required for
that project must be installed in that virtual enviroment
so that dependencies installed for one project may
not hamper the working of another project.

Module:virtualenv

pip install virtualenv.


Before creating enviroment, you must direct cmd prompt
to flask project folder (project directory)
Command to create Virtual env

1) virtualenv enviroment name

2) python -m virtualenv enviroment name

   virtualenv env 
   or
   python -m virtualenv env
   
   
   C:\python912wk\flask project
   
3) To activate virtual environment env
   
   env\Scripts\activate 
   
4) To deactivate virtual environment env
   
   env\Scripts\deactivate 
   
5) After activating virtual env install flask.
 
    pip install flask
	

Tools to develope web application
================================
1) Browser
2) Server- flask provide server
3) DBMS-mysql(xampp)
4) Code editor
   python-IDLE
   HTML  - notepad++
   
   
Create object of Flask class.
In flask module there is Flask class whose object
need to be created to execute certain methods.

datetime-> module
datetime-> class


run(): This method is used to run server provided 
       by flask.
	  This method belong to Flask class, thus there
	  is a need to create object of Flask Class.
	
   
ctrl+c => to stop server on cmd-prompt

  https://www.itvedant.com/
  
  http://127.0.0.1:5000
  
  www.domainname.com => ip address:port no
  

Request - Response Cycle.

step1: Client give request http://127.0.0.1:5000/contact
step2: Request is given to flask server.
step3: flask server tries to match 
       url part(apart from base url:http://127.0.0.1:5000)
	   with the url in route() method
  	   defined in main.py files.
step4: Every route() method is associated with a
       user defined function.
	   So once route parameter or url get matched 
	   with the url received from client request, it 
	   call or invoke that function.
step 5: That function provide response to the client.


Todo list application
=====================

Dashboard creation
==================

Heading of Dashboard (h1 tag in HTML)

Create Task => link (anchor tag in HTML)

Table to list all his task
==========================

          Title    Details    Date       Edit   Delete
		  Car    Wash Car    26-06-2022  edit   delete




When user click on create task ,an empty form 
must be shown

          C1     C2
		  
        Title :_____________   r1
		
		Detail:_____________   r2
		
		Date  :_____________   r3
		
		submit                 r4





form                         main.py (/store)            Database            
														 task
